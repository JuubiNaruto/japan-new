    <p>Osaka Japan is owned by JuubiPain. Here you can buy plots in the town and apply to be a member of the town. Osaka is in the nation of Japan and is usually friendly. We aren't a fan of war but will go to war if need be. As one of the 4 towns of japan we have power. Osaka is ready for anything. We also have outposts in other continents so we can have good land. Because our land has a lot of water we will try to take it out but we might not be able to. Outposts are used to have a location on flat land. We will have the train station going through japan linking all of the towns. The trains will be minecarts or boats on ice.</p>
