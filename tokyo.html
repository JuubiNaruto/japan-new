    <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan and is the most powerful town. As the capital Tokyo has the most land and owns Mt. Fuji. Tokyo is very powerful but they don't like war and would prefer to stay out of it. Tokyo aims to claim a ton of land and push the nation of Japan even further. Because Tokyo is the capital of the nation of Japan they have a lot on there hands. Tokyo also has to enforce their town rules. Because of all the water running through the terrain in Japan its hard to build and towns may have to resort to going in different continent to get flat land or land that doesn't have a ton of water flowing through it.</p>
